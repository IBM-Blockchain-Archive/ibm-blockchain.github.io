## Develop in a cloud sandbox
## IBM Blockchain Platform

Follow the instructions on [ibm-blockchain.github.io](https://ibm-blockchain.github.io) to launch a basic IBM Blockchain network on the IBM Container Service's free plan. At the end of the install, you will be able to obtain a public URL to access your instance of Composer Playground (the UI for creating and deploying Business Networks to Fabric).

You will need to clone the [ibm-container-service](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/ibm-container-service) repository to get the relevant bash scripts and YAML files.
