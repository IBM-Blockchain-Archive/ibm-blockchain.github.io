# Simple Install

## Before you start
Make sure you have followed the instructions in **Prepare & Setup** - they are a prerequisite to any of the install instructions.

## Install with a single script

The Simple Install method is to use the all in one script - ``create_all.sh`` - which will call a series of scripts to ultimately bootstrap a blockchain network, join peers to a channel and launch the Composer playground.  You can then use Composer Playground to create and deploy Business Networks to your blockchain network.

### 1. Clone this repository
You'll be using the config files and scripts from this repository, so start by cloning it to a directory of your choice on your local machine.

### 2. Run the script

Navigate to the ``scripts`` sub-directory:
```bash
cd cs-offerings/free/scripts
```

Now run the script:
```bash
./create_all.sh
```
